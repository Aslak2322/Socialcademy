# Ios social-media app 
Lets you create a user, posts and comment.

## Architecture

This iOS app follows the **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** pattern with a separate **Services** layer for backend interactions.  

- **Model:** User, Post, Comment objects  
- **ViewModel:** Handles logic and prepares data for the UI  
- **View:** SwiftUI components  
- **Services:** Interact with Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Auth for authentication
